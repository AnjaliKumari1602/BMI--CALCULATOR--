 🧮 BMI CALCULATOR 

A simple, fast, and user-friendly Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator built using Python and Tkinter.  
This desktop application allows users to enter their height (cm) and weight (kg) and instantly displays their BMI value along with the corresponding health category

📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Tkinter GUI library in Python to build a clean and interactive interface.  
It uses the standard BMI formula to determine whether the user is:
- Underweight  
- Normal  
- Overweight  
- Obese  
The application is lightweight and runs entirely offline.

🎯 Objectives
- Provide an easy-to-use GUI for BMI calculation  
- Apply the BMI formula correctly  
- Automatically classify users into health categories  
- Create a simple desktop health application 

🧠 BMI Calculation Formula
Height entered in centimeters is automatically converted to meters.
🚀 Features
✔ Easy-to-use Tkinter interface  
✔ Instant BMI calculation  
✔ Shows category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)  
✔ Error message for invalid inputs  
✔ Works completely offline 

📂 Project Structure

📊 BMI Categories
| BMI Range   | Category        |
|-------------|------------------|
| < 18.5      | Underweight      |
| 18.5 – 24.9 | Normal Weight    |
| 25 – 29.9   | Overweight       |
| ≥ 30        | Obese            |
🔧 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Tkinter GUI  
- Built-in Python modules  

 🧪 Testing
Application tested with:
- Valid height and weight inputs  
- Invalid inputs (handled with error popups)  
- Edge case BMI values (18.5, 24.9, 29.9)  
- GUI responsiveness 

 🏁 Conclusion
The BMI Calculator is an effective and user-friendly desktop tool.  
It demonstrates GUI development using Python Tkinter and basic health computation logic.
